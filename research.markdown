Stellar streams have been a promising tool to study the structures and accretion history of the Milky Way (MW).The progenitors of stellar streams are dwarf galaxies or globular clusters that fell into the potential well of the MW in the past, having their stars stripped out along their orbits. Interaction of a stream with a low-mass subhalo shows that it creates a discontinuity in the stream’s orbital energy distribution, which will later evolve into a gap or fluctuations in surface density of stars along the stream. These low-mass subhalos, which are otherwise dark, cannot be detected by direct observation. However, their existence is crucial in constraining the temperature of dark matter models. We study simulated streams in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to model stream-subhalo interactions that will estimate the mass profile of interacting subhalos. We have done the following research in order to work towards that goal.

We study and try to characterize progenitors of tidal streams in [FIRE-2 cosmological simulations](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.480..800H/abstract).

#### *how to pick out stellar streams*
![my picture!](/assets/assets/stream_local_vel_dispersion.png)
We identify stream candidates by picking out objects that are bound between 2.7 to 6.5 Gyr ago and are within present day's virial radius of the host. Then, these candidates are classified into 3 catagories: satellite, phase-mixed object and stream. Satellites are ruled out by their compact sizes. We rule out phase-mixed objects by a criterion on the local velocity dispersion shown in the plot as a black dashed line where sample objects that were classified by eye as phase-mixed and stream are plotted in orange and blue, respectively.

#### *key results*
1. The progenitors have no preferred mass range
2. The streams are getting colder over time, just as we expect from the conservation of phase-space volume
3. Streams' progenitors are relatively iron-poor, compared to present-day satellites.
