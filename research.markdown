### **Properties of Stellar Streams' Progenitors (Panithanpaisal *et al.* in prep.)**
We study properties and statistics of stellar streams' progenitors in FIRE-2
cosmological simulations.

#### *how to pick out stellar streams*
We found that phase-mixed objects can be effectively ruled out based on their
local velocity dispersion.
