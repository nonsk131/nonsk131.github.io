### **The Galaxy Progenitors of Stellar Streams around Milky Way-mass Galaxies in the FIRE cosmological simulations (submitted to *ApJ*)**

This is a project that I am working my PhD advisor, Robyn Sanderson. We study and try to characterize progenitors of tidal streams in [FIRE-2 cosmological simulations](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.480..800H/abstract).

#### *how to pick out stellar streams*
We found that phase-mixed objects can be effectively ruled out based on their
local velocity dispersion.  

#### *key results*
1. The progenitors have no preferred mass range
2. The streams are getting colder over time, just as we expect from the conservation of phase-space volume
3. Streams' progenitors are relatively iron-poor, compared to present-day satellites.
