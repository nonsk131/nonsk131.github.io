Stellar streams have been a promising tool to study the structures and accretion history of the Milky Way (MW).The progenitors of stellar streams are dwarf galaxies or globular clusters that fell into the potential well of the MW in the past, having their stars stripped out along their orbits. Interaction of a stream with a low-mass subhalo shows that it creates a discontinuity in the stream’s orbital energy distribution, which will later evolve into a gap or fluctuations in surface density of stars along the stream. These low-mass subhalos, which are otherwise dark, cannot be detected by direct observation. However, their existence is crucial in constraining the temperature of dark matter models. We study simulated streams in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to model stream-subhalo interactions that will estimate the mass profile of interacting subhalos. We have done the following research in order to work towards that goal.

This is a project that I am working my PhD advisor, Robyn Sanderson. We study and try to characterize progenitors of tidal streams in [FIRE-2 cosmological simulations](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.480..800H/abstract).

#### *how to pick out stellar streams*
We found that phase-mixed objects can be effectively ruled out based on their
local velocity dispersion.  

#### *key results*
1. The progenitors have no preferred mass range
2. The streams are getting colder over time, just as we expect from the conservation of phase-space volume
3. Streams' progenitors are relatively iron-poor, compared to present-day satellites.
