Hi, everyone! My name is **Nondh Panithanpaisal (นนท์ ปณิธานไพศาล)**. I am currently a third year PhD student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania. My research interests are in the areas of astrophysics and cosmology, especially computational astrophysics. I am working under the supervision of professor [Robyn Sanderson](https://www.physics.upenn.edu/index.php/people/standing-faculty/robyn-sanderson). Please click on the research tab to learn more about the research that we are doing and also check out our [research group website](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/dynamics/).

I grew up in Bangkok, Thailand. When I am not working, I enjoy traveling, stargazing, learning new languages and watching Japanese anime. The languages that I speak (from best to worst) are ภาษาไทย, English, 中文 and 日本語.

Here is my [curriculum vitae](/assets/NondhPanithanpaisalCV.pdf).
