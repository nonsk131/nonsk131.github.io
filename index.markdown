Hi, everyone! I am **Nondh Panithanpaisal (นนท์ ปณิธานไพศาล)**, a Carnegie-Caltech Joint Postdoctoral Fellow in Theoretical Astrophysics. Currently, I work under the guidance of Dr. [Ana Bonana](https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/dr-ana-bonaca-0) (Carnegie Observatories), Prof. [Phil Hopkins](https://pma.caltech.edu/people/philip-f-hopkins) (Caltech), and Prof. [Robyn Sanderson](https://www.physics.upenn.edu/index.php/people/standing-faculty/robyn-sanderson) (UPenn). Feel free to click on the [Research]({{ site.url }}/research) tab to learn more about my past and ongoing research (last updated: 2021) and the [Data Release]({{ site.url }}/data_release) tab to access publicly available data (last updated: 2021).

Here are the keywords for my research: stellar streams, galactic dynamics, galactic archaeology, and dark matter. Specifically, as a member of the FIRE collaboration, I use state-of-the-art cosmological simulations to study stellar streams (populations of disrupted dwarf galaxies and globular clusters) in order to constrain properties of the host galaxies as well as dark matter. For the current list of my publications, see [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=%20author%3A%22Panithanpaisal%2C%20Nondh%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0)/[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BL94RZQAAAAJ&hl=en)

I grew up in Bangkok, Thailand. When I am not working, I enjoy traveling, stargazing, learning new languages and watching Japanese anime. The languages that I speak (from best to worst) are ภาษาไทย, English, 中文 and 日本語.

Here is my [curriculum vitae](/assets/NondhPanithanpaisalCV.pdf).
