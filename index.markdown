My name is **Nondh Panithanpaisal (นนท์ ปณิธานไพศาล)**. I am currently a second year PhD student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania. My research interests are in the areas of astrophysics and cosmology, especially computational astrophysics. I am working under the supervision of professor Robyn Sanderson.    

I grew up in Bangkok, Thailand, where I did my secondary school (grade 7 to 12) at โรงเรียนสวนกุหลาบวิทยาลัย. I have been interested in astronomy, so stargazing is one of my hobbies. Throughout high school, I participated in astronomy and astrophysics olympiad, where I won 1 gold medal and 1 silver medal from the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics, and won 1 silver medal from the International Astronomy Olympiad.
