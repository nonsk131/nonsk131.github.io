Hi, everyone! My name is **Nondh Panithanpaisal (นนท์ ปณิธานไพศาล)**. I am currently a third year PhD student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania. My research interests are in the areas of astrophysics and cosmology, especially computational astrophysics. I am working under the supervision of professor [Robyn Sanderson](https://www.physics.upenn.edu/index.php/people/standing-faculty/robyn-sanderson). We are learning about stellar streams, their progenitors, and ultimately how to use them to detect low-mass, dark subhalos that are predicted to exist in the Milky Way.    

I grew up in Bangkok, Thailand. When I am not working, I enjoy traveling, star gazing, learning new languages and watching Japanese anime.
