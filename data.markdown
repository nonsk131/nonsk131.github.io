### SAPFIRE (**S**tream **A**nd their **P**rogenitors in the **FIRE** cosmological simulations)
![stream_pic](/assets/one_stream_unwrap.png)
This is a catalogue of 100+ present-day simulated stellar streams with galaxy progenitors. These streams are selected from the Latte suite and ElVIS suite of FIRE-2 cosmological simulations of isolated and paired Milky Way-mass galaxies. The dataset includes positions, velocities, metallicities of star particles, as well as, the infall, quenching, and tidal disruption timescales for each stream. The stream classification and determination of important timescales are described in detail in Panithanpaisal et al 2021.

The full catalogue can be access via [FlatHub](https://flathub.flatironinstitute.org/sapfire)
